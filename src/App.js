//Please note, I haven't actually really learned much about react (4 years off raising kids). This project has been bootstrapped using create-react-app to begin. I wrote this in vanilla JS and have attempted to refactor using react. I am sure there is a lot that I can change and I will do so once I learn more about it. Either way, tadaaaaaa.

         //ok so here, I don't want to just use a random value on spin so we will get the difference between the time from the mousedown moment to the mouse up moment and use that for the rotate angle. I suspect handling the events this way defeats the purpose of react but I will revisit once I have time to read up more on react.
